# Wine Quality Prediction with Text and Non-text Data
This project is adapted from a homework I did with one of my classmates (Bo Jumrustanasan) on the course COMS 4995 Applied Machine Learning by Dr. Andreas C. MÃ¼ller at Columbia University. The aim is to predict the wine points in a [wine review dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews). The project includes the following parts:

1. data visualization
2. data preprocessing and imputation using pipelines
3. grid search on Linear Regression, Elastic Net, and LinearSVR to build a baseline linear model
4. modeling with text features using Bag of Words (BoW) and word-embedding

The final model is a Linear Regression model with BoW and word-embedding. The test accuracy is 77%.
