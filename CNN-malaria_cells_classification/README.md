# Malaria Cells Classification Using CNN 
This sample shows a classification of Malaria cells using CNN. It is modified from a homework I did with one of my classmates (Bo Jumrustanasan) on the course COMS 4995 Applied Machine Learning by Dr. Andreas C. MÃ¼ller at Columbia University. The dataset is [Malaria Dataset](https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/publication/pub9932). The sample includes the following work:
1. data preparation: downloading, resizing, train_test_split
2. data agumentation
3. CNN building and training
4. model evaluation
